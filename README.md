## NeurIPS AutoML Decathlon Competition 2022

This repository contains my final submission to the AutoML decathlon
competition which won 4th place. Access the competition page

This flowchart illustrates the model selection strategy:

Main rules I tried to follow:

1. Donâ€™t overfit to the train tasks
    - Keep models simple.
    - Try not to look at the data.
    - Reduce the number of moving parts / isolate improvements.
2. Be wary of time and memory constraints
    - Check how much time you have left and stop training accordingly.
3. There is no free lunch
    - Inductive bias is important. Pick the right model class for every
      type of task.
